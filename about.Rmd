# Motivation

Two major wildfire disasters occurred recently: Australia BushFire, and California CampFire. The severe consequences of wildfires on the environment and health catches our attention. We might not have the ability to avoid wildfire, however, we are able to understand more about it, and maybe find a better way to minimize the losses in future. Therefore, this study will be conducted to see the potential factors of wildfire, in order to have some insight into wildfire. Since there are plenty of studies focusing on wildfire in the US and Australia, we decided to start our project in a new place to us, Portugal. In the project, we will compare the weather and climate conditions of The Montesinho Natural Park, one of the largest natural parks in Portugal.

### Montesinho National Park

The Montesinho Natural Park is one of the largest natural parks in Portugal. The schist and granite mountains form deep valleys and the clear river water flowing through them. The geological diversity of this space and variations in soil characteristics and climate, originate a highly varied plant life, and an ideal habitat for animals such as the wolf, wild boar, roe deer and around 240 other animal species. Montesinho is home to many different kinds of animals. Its biodiversity includes the Iberian wolf, roe deer, wild boar, Iberian lynx, common genet, red fox and European otter.

# Data

The forest fire data concerns burned areas of the forests in Montesinho Natural park due to forest fires.

### Variables

* X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
* Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
* month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
* day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
* FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
* DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
* DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
* ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
* temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
* RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
* wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
* rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
* area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
sense to model with the logarithm transform)

# What Questions we are trying to answer?

**Overview**

* How is the forest fire distributed in the park?

* Where in the park has the most severe fire?

* How large can the forest fire be?


**Data Analysis** 

* Which of the climate variables have significant effect on wild fires?

* How are these variables related to the burned area of forest fire?
