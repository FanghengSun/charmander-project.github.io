## Motivation

Two major wildfire disasters occurred recently: Australia BushFire, and California CampFire. The severe consequences of wildfires on the environment and health catches our attention. We might not have the ability to avoid wildfire, however, we are able to find a better way to minimize the losses. Fast detection plays an important role in a successful firefighting. Therefore, this study will be conducted to see the potential factors of wildfire, in order to have some insight of wildfire detection. Since there are plenty of studies focusing on wildfire in the US and Australia, we decided to start our project in a new place to us, Portugal. We will compare the weather and climate conditions of The Montesinho Natural Park, one of the largest natural parks in Portugal.

## Background Information

### The Montesinho Natural Park

[The Montesinho Natural Park](https://www.montesinho.com/en) is a protected area located in the northeastern Portugal. It is one of the largest natural parks in Portugal.

The geological diversity of this space and variations in soil characteristics and climate, originate a highly varied plant life, and an ideal habitat for animals.Its biodiversity includes the [Iberian wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_wolf), [roe deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_deer), [wild boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar), [Iberian lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx), [common genet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_genet), [red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox), [European otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_otter), and around 240 other animal species.

### Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System

The Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System is an estimation of risk of wildfire. It includes six components: FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI.

The first three components are fuel moisture codes. The values rise as the moisture content decreases.

The remaining three components are fire behavior indexes. As the three values rise, the fire danger increases.

The image below shows the associations of all six components of the FWI System. ![](picture/FWI_structure.jpg)

* Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)

  The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) is a numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels. It is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel.

* Duff Moisture Code (DMC)

  The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. It gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material.

* Drought Code (DC)

  The Drought Code (DC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. It is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.

* Initial Spread Index (ISI)

  The Initial Spread Index (ISI) is a numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It is based on wind speed and FFMC. Like the rest of the FWI system components, ISI does not take fuel type into account. Actual spread rates vary between fuel types at the same ISI.

* Buildup Index (BUI)

  The Buildup Index (BUI) is a numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion. It is based on the DMC and the DC. The BUI is generally less than twice the DMC value, and moisture in the DMC layer is expected to help prevent burning in material deeper down in the available fuel.

* Fire Weather Index (FWI)

  The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a numeric rating of fire intensity. It is based on ISI and BUI, and is used as a general index of fire danger throughout the forested areas of Canada.

### Data Set Information

The forest fire data concerns burned areas of the forests in Montesinho Natural park due to forest fires.

In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.
Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were
post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
(REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,
the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority.

### Variables of interest

For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007].

* X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
* Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
* month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
* day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
* FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
* DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
* DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
* ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
* temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
* RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
* wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
* rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
* area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
sense to model with the logarithm transform)
