## Motivation

Two major wildfire disasters occurred recently: Australia BushFire, and California CampFire. The severe consequences of wildfires on the environment and health catches our attention. We might not have the ability to avoid wildfire, however, we are able to find a better way to minimize the losses. Therefore, this study will be conducted to see the potential factors of wildfire, in order to have some insight of wildfire detection. Since there are plenty of studies focusing on wildfire in the US and Australia, we decided to start our project in a new place to us, Portugal. We will compare the weather and climate conditions of The Montesinho Natural Park, one of the largest natural parks in Portugal.

## Related work

Our study is mainly inspired by the following idea, articles, website, and research:

* From [Wildfires and Climate Change](https://www.c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-climate-change/), we know that wildfire risk strongly depends on a number of weather factors, including temperature, wind, rain, soil moisture, and the presence of other potential fuel, etc. Thus, it gave us the hint of where we can start when conducting the analysis.


* [US Wildfire Map](https://www.esri.com/en-us/disaster-response/disasters/wildfires) is an interactive real-time wildfire map for the United States. It displays current wildfire locations as reported by responding agencies and other sources of information related to wildfires.

## Background Information

### The Montesinho Natural Park

[The Montesinho Natural Park](https://www.montesinho.com/en) is a protected area located in the northeastern Portugal. It is one of the largest natural parks in Portugal.

The geological diversity of this space and variations in soil characteristics and climate, originate a highly varied plant life, and an ideal habitat for animals.Its biodiversity includes the [Iberian wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_wolf), [roe deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_deer), [wild boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar), [Iberian lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx), [common genet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_genet), [red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox), [European otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_otter), and around 240 other animal species.

### Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System

The Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System is an estimation of risk of wildfire. It includes six components: FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI.

The first three components are fuel moisture codes. The three values rise as the moisture content decreases.

The remaining three components are fire behavior indexes. The three values rise as the fire danger increases.

The figure below illustrates the six components of the FWI System.
<img src="picture/FWI_structure.jpg">



* Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)

  The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) is a numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels. This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel.
  

* Duff Moisture Code (DMC)

  The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. It gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material.
  

* Drought Code (DC)

  The Drought Code (DC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. It is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.
  

* Initial Spread Index (ISI)

  The Initial Spread Index (ISI) is a numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It is based on wind speed and FFMC. Like the rest of the FWI system components, ISI does not take fuel type into account. Actual spread rates vary between fuel types at the same ISI.
  

* Buildup Index (BUI) (Not included in this project)

  The Buildup Index (BUI) is a numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion. It is based on the DMC and the DC. The BUI is generally less than twice the DMC value, and moisture in the DMC layer is expected to help prevent burning in material deeper down in the available fuel.
  

* Fire Weather Index (FWI)

  The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a numeric rating of fire intensity. It is based on the ISI and the BUI, and is used as a general index of fire danger throughout the forested areas of Canada.

## Questions
Our questions remained stable throughout the development of our project. They can be concluded in three dimensions.

**Overview**

* How is the forest fire distributed in the park?

* Where in the park has the most severe fire?

* How large can the forest fire be?


**Data Analysis** 

* Which of the climate variables have significant effect on wild fires?

* How are these variables related to the burned area of forest fire?


**Suggestion** 

* For general tourists, what suggestions can we provide from the data? 

* For fire departments, what suggestions can we provide from the data?

## Data

#### ***Sources***

[Paulo Cortez Home Page](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/Home.html)

#### ***Data Set Information***

The forest fire data concerns burned areas of the forests in Montesinho Natural park due to forest fires.

In [Cortez and Morais, 2007](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf), the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.

#### ***Variables of interest***

For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007].

* X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
* Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
* month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
* day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
* FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
* DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
* DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
* ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
* temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
* RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
* wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
* rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
* area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
sense to model with the logarithm transform)

## Exploratory Analysis

In `Overview`, we can find `Descriptive Statistics`, `Geography`, and `Observation by Time`, each part can guide the users to deeper understanding of what we have done with the dataset.

[Geography](https://tracici25.github.io/charmander-project.github.io/geography.html) shows users a whole picture of the counts of wildfire in each area. Darker areas represent higher counts of wildfires in that area across year 2000 to 2003.


[Observation by Time](https://yuechen-liu.shinyapps.io/time/) is an interactive dashboard that allows users to examine the patterns of wildfires in several weather conditions of The Montesinho Natural Park. Users can get the picture of the wildfires from two aspects: by monthly, or by the types of day (weekday vs weekends). 

[]() allows users to select different years () and variables, to demonstrate the changes in trends in disasters or climate indicators over time and to visualize differences across the country. Variable definitions can be seen above in the “Data Cleaning” section.
